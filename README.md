This is a simple javaFX project. It is a Game which main character is a snake. The game contains 5 levels. The snake can be controlled 
with W (up), S(down), R(right), L(left). Its speed increases sometimes. There is a "magic" (blue) box which appears on a period of time.
Its power is to decrease snake's speed for a short time. On the last level there is no limit about playing - the only problem which can 
cause "Game Over" is snake's self-destroy.
